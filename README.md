# X509Certificates

## 1. Introduction

The **System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates** namespace in .NET is part of the System.Security.Cryptography library

It provides classes that help you work with **X.509** certificates

These are digital certificates that follow the **X.509** standard defined by the ITU (International Telecommunication Union)

**X.509** certificates are used in many security protocols, including SSL/TLS for securing web communications

Certificates serve as a form of digital identity for entities (like servers, clients, or users) and can be used for various purposes, 

such as encrypting data, signing code, or establishing secure connections over the internet

Key classes and types in the **System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates** namespace include:

**X509Certificate and X509Certificate2**: These classes represent an X.509 certificate

X509Certificate2 is an enhanced version that provides more functionality than the X509Certificate class

**X509Store**: Represents a store of certificates. This can be thought of as a database on the system that holds certificates

**X509Chain**: Used to build a chain of certificates from a given certificate to a root certificate authority (CA). It helps in verifying the validity of a certificate

**X509CertificateCollection**: A collection that stores multiple X.509 certificates

## 2. Establishing an SSL/TLS Connection

A very common use case for **System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates** is to establish an **SSL/TLS** connection to a server in a secure manner

This involves validating the **server's SSL certificate** to ensure it's **trusted**, valid, and matches the server you're connecting to

Here's a simplified C# example application that demonstrates how to make an HTTPS request to a **server** while validating its **SSL certificate** using the **X509Certificate2** class

This example overrides the default server certificate validation to introduce custom logic, which is generally not recommended for production unless you have a very specific

reason and understand the security implications

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Security;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12;
        // Override the default server certificate validation callback
        ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = ServerCertificateCustomValidation;

        string url = "https://example.com";
        HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url);
        using (HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse())
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Response status: {response.StatusCode}");
        }
    }

    // Custom validation function
    private static bool ServerCertificateCustomValidation(object sender, X509Certificate certificate, X509Chain chain, SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors)
    {
        // Here you can examine the server's certificate and chain to apply custom logic
        // For demonstration, we're just printing the server certificate details
        Console.WriteLine($"Server Certificate Issuer: {certificate.Issuer}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Server Certificate Subject: {certificate.Subject}");

        // You could also check certificate properties, like expiration, issuer name, etc.
        // For now, we'll trust any certificate (not recommended for production!)
        return true;
    }
}
```
