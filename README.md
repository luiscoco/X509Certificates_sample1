# X509Certificates

The **System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates** namespace in .NET is part of the System.Security.Cryptography library

It provides classes that help you work with **X.509** certificates

These are digital certificates that follow the **X.509** standard defined by the ITU (International Telecommunication Union)

**X.509** certificates are used in many security protocols, including SSL/TLS for securing web communications

Certificates serve as a form of digital identity for entities (like servers, clients, or users) and can be used for various purposes, 

such as encrypting data, signing code, or establishing secure connections over the internet

Key classes and types in the **System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates** namespace include:

**X509Certificate and X509Certificate2**: These classes represent an X.509 certificate. X509Certificate2 is an enhanced version that provides more functionality than the X509Certificate class

**X509Store**: Represents a store of certificates. This can be thought of as a database on the system that holds certificates

**X509Chain**: Used to build a chain of certificates from a given certificate to a root certificate authority (CA). It helps in verifying the validity of a certificate

**X509CertificateCollection**: A collection that stores multiple X.509 certificates
